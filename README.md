  # CSC490: Mapillary Vistas Dataset
  ### Abdurrahman Choudry, Ryan Dâ€™Rosario, Hanchao Ge, Matthew Ho Kin

  The problem we will be addressing for our project is regarding semantic segmentation and object detection with regards to street scenes, namely, pixel by pixel segmentation of a street image into a set of classes. We will be using the Mapillary Vistas Dataset, and ideally we would be able to build a model that can run in real-time or can accept a user's input, such as a phone image/video, or dashcam footage.
